# GodotCodingGuidelines
This project is my personal coding style that I have written out on paper. It is meant
to aid me in my time of need when I don't know what to type my code like.

Go to "FullScript.gd" to get a whole file for coding practices. It doesn't explicitly name all of them,
which is why I added the "Functions" and "Variables" gd classes.
